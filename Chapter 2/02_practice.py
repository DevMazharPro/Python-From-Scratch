# Program 1: Add Two Numbers
a = 4
b = 5
print(a + b)

# Program 2: Find the remainder of a/b
a = 4
b = 5
print(a % b)

# Program 3: Check the type of the variable assigned using input() function
a = input("Enter a number: ")
print(type(a))

# Program 4: Use comparison operator to find out whether a given variable a is greater than 'b' or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80
a = 34
b = 80
print(a > b)

# Program 5: Write a Python program to find the average of two numbers entered by the user
a = int(input("Enter a number: "))
b = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print((a + b) / 2)

# Program 6: Write a Python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user
a = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(a ** 2)
